# Sales
Sales is a small database that contains data of customers details and their purchases.
The size of the database can be controlled by the parameters.json file.
The range of data can also be controlled here.

## Creating the database
If you already have mysql and python set up on your local machine, you can go ahead and run 

```batch
python3 sales/scripts/sales database.py
```

This should create the database along with all routines, functions, views along with some test data.
